# User Personas

## Primary Persona: The Brand Marketer

### Profile: Sarah Chen
**Age**: 29  
**Role**: Digital Marketing Manager  
**Company**: GlowUp Cosmetics (25 employees)  
**Location**: Austin, TX  
**Experience**: 4 years in digital marketing

### Background
Sarah manages all social media and digital advertising for a growing DTC skincare brand. Her team is just her and one part-time social media coordinator. They're competing against brands with 10x the budget and full creative teams.

### Goals
- Create 20-30 video ads per month for Meta, TikTok, and Instagram
- Test different messaging angles without blowing budget
- Maintain consistent brand aesthetic across all content
- Respond quickly to trending topics and seasonal campaigns
- Prove ROI on every dollar spent

### Pain Points
- **Budget Constraints**: Can only afford 2-3 professionally produced videos per month ($3,000-5,000 each)
- **Slow Turnaround**: Agency takes 2-3 weeks to deliver, missing trend windows
- **Limited Variations**: Wants to A/B test everything but can't afford it
- **Brand Inconsistency**: When she DIYs videos in Canva, they don't match brand guidelines
- **Platform Adaptation**: Needs different aspect ratios and lengths for each platform

### Current Workflow
1. Brief external agency or freelancer ($1,500-2,500 per video)
2. Wait 2-3 weeks for first draft
3. Go through 2-3 revision rounds
4. Get final video, manually resize for different platforms
5. Can only afford to do this 2x per month
6. Fill gaps with static image posts or basic Canva animations

### Frustrations
> "By the time the agency delivers, the trend I wanted to capitalize on is already over. And when I ask for variations, it's another $500 and another week."

> "I know exactly what I want—I just need someone to execute it fast and on-brand. I don't need 'creative direction,' I need speed."

### How Zapcut Solves Her Problems
- **Speed**: Generate 5 ad variations in 15 minutes instead of waiting weeks
- **Cost**: $10-20 per video instead of $1,500+
- **Control**: Describe exactly what she wants in natural language
- **Consistency**: Creative Bible locks brand aesthetic across all variations
- **Testing**: A/B test 10 different hooks in a single afternoon

### Success Scenario
Sarah needs holiday campaign videos for Instagram and TikTok:
1. Opens Zapcut, selects "GlowUp Cosmetics" brand
2. Uploads product shot of new winter moisturizer
3. Chat with AI: "Create 3 versions of a cozy winter skincare ad, show product with warm lighting, candles, snow outside window"
4. AI generates Creative Bible maintaining GlowUp's minimalist aesthetic
5. 12 minutes later: 3 complete 15-second ads ready to publish
6. Exports vertical (9:16) for TikTok, square (1:1) for Instagram feed
7. Tests all 3, finds winner, requests 2 more variations of that style
8. Entire process: 30 minutes, $50 total cost

## Secondary Persona: The Independent Music Producer

### Profile: Alex Rivera
**Age**: 24  
**Role**: Independent Music Producer & Artist  
**Platforms**: Spotify (50K followers), YouTube (25K subscribers), Instagram (80K followers)  
**Location**: Los Angeles, CA  
**Experience**: 3 years making beats, 1 year releasing original music

### Background
Alex produces lo-fi hip-hop and electronic music. He releases a new track every 2-3 weeks and knows that YouTube thumbnails and visual content drive 70% of his discovery. Currently uses stock footage and simple visualizers, but they're not standing out.

### Goals
- Release a music video for every track (24+ per year)
- Create visually distinctive content that matches each song's vibe
- Stay within budget ($0-200 per video)
- Post content quickly while song is still fresh
- Build a recognizable visual brand across videos

### Pain Points
- **Cost**: Professional music videos cost $5,000-15,000 (impossible on indie budget)
- **DIY Limitations**: Stock footage compilations look cheap and generic
- **Time**: Learning After Effects would take months
- **Inconsistency**: Every video looks different because he's using random stock clips
- **Competition**: Bigger artists have entire creative teams

### Current Workflow
1. Finish song in Ableton
2. Search stock footage sites for 2-3 hours
3. Download 10-15 clips that "feel right"
4. Spend 4-6 hours in Premiere Pro cutting clips to beat
5. Add simple effects and color grading
6. Upload to YouTube with basic thumbnail
7. Result: Looks okay but not professional, doesn't match song perfectly

### Frustrations
> "I spend more time searching for stock footage than I do making the actual music. And it never looks as good as I imagine."

> "I can hear the exact visuals I want when I make the track, but I don't have the skills or money to execute it."

### How Zapcut Solves His Problems
- **Cost-Effective**: $20-40 per music video vs $5,000+
- **Speed**: Upload song, describe vibe, get video in 10 minutes
- **Quality**: Cinematic AI-generated visuals that sync to beats
- **Consistency**: Establish a visual style that carries across all releases
- **Creative Control**: Describe exact aesthetic in natural language

### Success Scenario
Alex just finished a dreamy synth-pop track called "Neon Rain":
1. Opens Zapcut, uploads the 3-minute song
2. Describes vision: "Ethereal city at night, neon signs reflecting in rain puddles, slow camera movements, pastel pink and blue colors, dreamy and melancholic"
3. AI analyzes song structure: intro (0-20s), verse (20-50s), chorus (50-80s), etc.
4. AI generates scene breakdown synced to beats
5. 8 minutes later: Complete music video with smooth transitions, perfect beat sync
6. Alex tweaks one scene ("make this part more abstract")
7. Re-generates that scene in 2 minutes
8. Publishes to YouTube with stunning video that matches the song perfectly
9. Total time: 15 minutes, $35 cost

## Tertiary Persona: The Agency Creative Director

### Profile: Marcus Thompson
**Age**: 38  
**Role**: Creative Director  
**Company**: Spark Creative Agency (12 employees)  
**Location**: Brooklyn, NY  
**Experience**: 15 years in advertising

### Background
Marcus runs a boutique creative agency serving mid-market consumer brands. His team is excellent at strategy and concepts, but production is becoming a bottleneck. Clients increasingly want "just one more variation" or "can we test this other approach?" without additional budget.

### Goals
- Deliver exceptional creative concepts to clients
- Increase profit margins by reducing production costs
- Respond faster to client feedback and requests
- Take on more clients without hiring additional editors
- Maintain creative quality and brand consistency

### Pain Points
- **Scope Creep**: Clients ask for variations that eat into margins
- **Production Bottleneck**: Has 2 editors who are always maxed out
- **Revision Hell**: Client feedback requires full re-edits, taking days
- **Testing Limitations**: Can't afford to produce 10 variations for A/B tests
- **Talent Costs**: Can't justify hiring another $80K/year editor

### Current Workflow
1. Strategy & concepting with client (1-2 weeks)
2. Client approves concept
3. Editors spend 3-5 days producing video
4. Client requests changes
5. Editors spend 1-2 days on revisions
6. Client asks for "3 more variations to test different hooks"
7. Marcus either:
   - Eats the cost (hurts margins)
   - Charges extra (client unhappy)
   - Says no (client disappointed)

### Frustrations
> "We're great at the creative strategy, but we're stuck in the production weeds. Half our time is spent on tactical execution instead of high-value creative thinking."

> "Clients have learned from Meta and TikTok that testing variations wins. They're right, but we can't produce 10 variations profitably."

### How Zapcut Solves His Problems
- **Margins**: Reduce production cost per video by 80%
- **Speed**: Generate variations in minutes instead of days
- **Scalability**: Take on 3x more clients with same team size
- **Value Shift**: Spend time on strategy, let AI handle execution
- **Client Delight**: Say "yes" to variation requests without killing margins

### Success Scenario
Marcus's team pitched a campaign concept for an outdoor gear client:
1. Client loves the concept, wants to test 8 different messaging angles
2. Previously: This would require 8 separate video productions ($40K+ and 6 weeks)
3. With Zapcut:
   - Marcus's team creates detailed Creative Bible with client's brand
   - Writes 8 different scripts (the valuable creative work)
   - Zapcut generates all 8 videos in 2 hours
   - Total cost: $200 + team time
4. Client tests all 8, finds 2 winners
5. Asks for 4 more variations of the winners
6. Marcus says "absolutely" and delivers them the same day
7. Client is thrilled, Marcus's margin went from 30% to 65%

## Anti-Persona: Who Zapcut Is NOT For

### The Hollywood Producer
**Why Not**: Needs frame-by-frame control, custom VFX, celebrity talent. Zapcut is for speed and volume, not cinematic perfection.

### The Amateur Experimenter
**Why Not**: Just wants to "play around" with AI video without a real use case. Zapcut optimizes for commercial use cases, not hobbyists.

### The Enterprise With 100-Person Creative Team
**Why Not**: (Initially) Has complex approval workflows, legal reviews, custom compliance needs that MVP doesn't support. (Future opportunity for Enterprise tier.)

### The Unrealistic Expectations Person
**Why Not**: Expects Zapcut to replace Pixar-level animation or match Super Bowl commercial production values. We're optimizing for 80% quality at 10% of the cost.
